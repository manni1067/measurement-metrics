/**
 * A channel provides a mechanism to queue work units for processing. Each work unit is
 * encapsulated as a ChannelMessage, and processing of each message is performed by a
 * ChannelHandler.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * As a request is handled by the system, it will travel through a sequence of channels.
 * This architecture has a number of advantages:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt; Each request doesn't need to correspond to a thread. Instead, a thread pool
 *          in each channel processes requests from a queue.
 *      &lt;li&gt; Due to the queue at each channel, the system is much better able to respond
 *          to load spikes.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * Channels are modeled after SEDA stages. For much much more in-depth architecture information,
 * refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mdw/proj/sandstorm/&quot;&gt;SEDA website&lt;/a&gt;.
