/**
 * ServerTrustManager is a Trust Manager that is only used for s2s connections. This TrustManager
 * is used both when the server connects to another server as well as when receiving a connection
 * from another server. In both cases, it is possible to indicate if self-signed certificates
 * are going to be accepted. In case of accepting a self-signed certificate a warning is logged.
 * Future version of the server might include a small workflow so admins can review self-signed
 * certificates or certificates of unknown issuers and manually accept them.
