/**
 * A SocketSendingTracker keeps track of all the sockets that are currently sending data and
 * checks the health of the sockets to detect hanged connections. If a sending operation takes
 * too much time (i.e. exceeds a time limit) then it is assumed that the connection has been
 * lost and for some reason the JVM has not been notified of the dead connection. Once a dead
 * connection has been detected it will be closed so that the thread that was writing to the
 * socket can resume. Resuming locked threads is important since otherwise a complete system halt
 * may occur.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * The time limit to wait before considering a connection dead can be configured changing the
 * property &lt;b&gt;xmpp.session.sending-limit&lt;/b&gt;. If the property was not defined then a default
 * time limit of 60 seconds will be assumed. This means that by default if a sending operation
 * takes longer than 60 seconds then the connection will be closed and the client disconnected.
 * Therefore, it is important to not set a very low time limit since active clients may be
 * incorrectly considered as dead clients.
