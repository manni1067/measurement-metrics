/**
 * An ad-hoc command is a stateless object responsbile for executing the provided service. Each
 * subclass will only have one instance that will be shared across all users sessions. Therefore,
 * it is important to not keep any information related to executions as permanent data
 * (i.e. as instance or static variables). Each command has a {@code code} that should be
 * unique within a given JID.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * Commands may have zero or more stages. Each stage is usually used for gathering information
 * required for the command execution. Users are able to move forward or backward across the
 * different stages. Commands may not be cancelled while they are beig executed. However, users
 * may request the &quot;cancel&quot; action when submiting a stage response indicating that the command
 * execution should be aborted. Thus, releasing any collected information. Commands that require
 * user interaction (i.e. have more than one stage) will have to provide the data forms the user
 * must complete in each stage and the allowed actions the user might perform during each stage
 * (e.g. go to the previous stage or go to the next stage).
