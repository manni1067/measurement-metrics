"When use commons collection 3.2.2, show ""JavaSE not found""",COLLECTIONS-585,12934997,Bug,Open,COLLECTIONS,Commons Collections,software,issues@commons.apache.org,,http://commons.apache.org/collections/,Minor,,,neal001,neal001,29/Jan/16 02:53,24/May/17 08:56,20/Jun/19 08:29,,3.2.2,Collection,,0,"Hi all, when i use commons-collections 3.2.2, and build my rcp application. it always show this error:
  [java] [eclipse.generateFeature] Some inter-plug-in dependencies have not been satisfied.
     [java] [eclipse.generateFeature] Bundle org.apache.commons.collections:
     [java] [eclipse.generateFeature] 	Host plug-in JavaSE_0.0.0 has not been found.

but for commons-collections 3.2.1.every thing is fine. 
and compared the 3.2.2 and 3.2.1 
Mainfest.mf file add this:
Require-Capability: osgi.ee;filter:=""(&(osgi.ee=JavaSE)(version=1.3))""
if remove it, i can build my application. 
i use jdk1.7 in my local(i also tested jdk1.8, same problem)
so i don't understand why show this problem.
i am new guy for this, if misunderstand this, sorry

Could you test with the latest version of Commons Collections and let us know if that works, and maybe add a comment explaining how to replicate your issue? That way we might be able to help debugging the issue, though I suspect it could be an IDE or environment issue.

Thanks
