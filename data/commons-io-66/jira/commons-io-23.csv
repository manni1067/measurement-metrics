FilenameUtils#normalizeNoEndSeparator returns null for UNC prefix without trailing backslash,IO-475,12819096,Bug,Open,IO,Commons IO,software,issues@commons.apache.org,Commons IO is a library of utilities to assist with developing IO functionality. ,http://commons.apache.org/io/,Minor,,,shoof,shoof,07/Apr/15 22:06,07/Apr/15 23:04,20/Jun/19 08:23,,1.4,2.0,2.0.1,2.1,2.2,2.3,2.4,,0,"FilenameUtils#normalizeNoEndSeparator returns null for UNC prefix without trailing backslash.

The observed behavior is that normalizeNoEndSeparator returns a non-null value for the following unc-path-prefix:
\\{serverName-or-IP}\

{backSlash}{backSlash}{serverName-or-IP}{backSlash} 
but returns null for the following unc-path-prefix:
\\{serverName-or-IP}

{backSlash}{backSlash}{serverName-or-IP}

The markdown seems to eat my backslashes prepended to the serverName-or-IP.

There is nothing in the Microsoft API documentation which would suggest that the second unc-path-prefix would be invalid.

Therefore the expectation is that they should be treated as equivalent by FilenameUtils#normalizeNoEndSeparator.

The handling of unc-path-prefix is inconsistent with how FilenameUtils#normalizeNoEndSeparator handles drive relative and drive absolute path prefixes, where each notation is accepted and returns a non-null --> ( C: and C:\ ).",,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,,,,,Important,Patch,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,2015-04-07 22:06:00.0,,,,,,0|i2cxq7:,9223372036854775807,,,,,,,,
